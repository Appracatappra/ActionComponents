## Frequently Asked Questions

The following is a list of frequently asked **Action Component** questions:

* **Can I use Action Components on multiple projects?**

	Yes, you are free to use our controls on as many apps as you like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can download or use the components, nor do we limit the number of devices that you can install our components on.
* **Are Action Components royalty free?**

	Yes, you are free to use our controls in any app project, even those for your customers if you develop apps for other companies, without royalties.
* **Can I install Action Components on multiple development machines?**

	The short answer is yes, you can install your copy of **Action Components** on as many development machines that you own. That said, **Action Components** are sold on a per developer seat license. If you have multiple developers, each one will need to purchase their own individual copy of the components. Discounts are available on multi-seat purchase, please contact sales for more details.
* **What does a year's subscription to Action Components provide?**

	**Action Components** are sold on a yearly license per developer seat. During your subscription period, you’ll receive any updates or bug fixes released during the year, free of charge. Additionally, you’ll receive any new UI control or time-saving feature added to the **Action Components** suite, again, free of charge, while your subscription is valid.
* **Will my Action Components stop working if I don't renew my license?**

	No, when you purchase a license to use **Action Components**, they are yours to keep forever and you can use them in as many projects as you like, royalty free. Your components will not stop working when your license expires and you will still be able to include them in new projects. However, you will no longer receive any new bug fixes, updates or feature enhancements so an update to iOS, Android, Xamarin or Visual Studio could potentially break compatibility with your component version.
